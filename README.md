Math-PY-Relations
=================

ðŸ”¥ About This Project  
--------------------  
This project combines Python with Mathematics to generate all possible relations in **Relations & Functions**.  
It is useful for students and developers who want to understand mathematical patterns through programming.  

ðŸŽ¯ Features  
-----------  
âœ” Automatic Cartesian Product calculation  
âœ” Generates all possible relations  
âœ” Maintains ordered elements  
âœ” Supports both 2 and 3 sets  
âœ” Enhances logical thinking and mathematical analysis  

ðŸš€ How to Run  
------------  
1. Open the terminal or command prompt.  
2. **Run the script**:  python Math-Py-Relations.py
3. Enter **elements for Set A and Set B** separated by commas.  
4. The program will generate and display all possible relations.  

ðŸ›  Future Enhancements  
----------------------  
- **Machine Learning Integration**: To predict mathematical patterns  
- **Statistical Analysis**: Useful in data science and research  
- **Graph Visualization**: Represent relations visually  
 
------------ 
If you want, we can take this project to more advanced levels,
such as machine learning, statistics, and mathematical modeling! ðŸš€
